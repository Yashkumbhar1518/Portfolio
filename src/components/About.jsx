           I have 1 year of experience as a Web Developer, building responsive and interactive applications. 
          Currently, I am learning DevOps and cloud technologies to automate deployments, manage infrastructure, 
          and implement CI/CD pipelines. I am looking for opportunities to apply my skills in a DevOps role 
          and contribute to building scalable and efficient systems.
